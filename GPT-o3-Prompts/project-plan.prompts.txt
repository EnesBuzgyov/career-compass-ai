I basically want to do something easy and qiuck that will teach me these skills, I want a UI and stuff, similar to existing gen ai models, and im thinking to do a career coach gen ai called career compass ai, eventually i wnat a website, how can i get a cheap domain name btw? also, i want to fine tune it and use RAG, i'm thinking to use a data set of resumes to see what skills and resume similarities get candidates for certain careers, so in the future if someone wants to figure out how to get a certain job to use my genai project, it will be better informed to help with resume help, skills necessary, plans, general job help, let's start small and build a prototype and iterate. Let's also pick a tech stack, is fast api, next.js a good start? What's most in demand for back end frameworks and front end
